# FinTech Module 2 Challenge
<li>This repository contains my FinTech Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge code.</li>
<h1>Background</h1>
<li>I'm progressing in my role as an application developer at a FinTech lending startup. The lending software that I've built so far has been a big success for the company. As part of that success, I've been meeting a lot with the Business Operations (BizOps) team to discuss creating additional useful features. At a recent meeting, a new, high-priority feature request emerged. Specifically, BizOps wants to know if my software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file. This project is a fantastic way to show off my new software engineering skills as I advance in my FinTech career.</li>
